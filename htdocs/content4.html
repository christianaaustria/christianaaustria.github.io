			<h1> Breonna Taylor </h1>
			<p> In early 2020, Breonna Taylor and his boyfriend were sleeping when three police officers to execute a search warrant in a drug case. This was a no knock warrant, meaning that the police officers broke in the their house. After breaking in, Breonna's boyfriend fired a gun as he thought an intruder was trying to break in. As a return, policed fired shots where 8 shots got to Breonna, causing her death. Police said that they were looking for drugs, unfortunately, they went to the wrong house (Breonna's house) as the suspect was already found earlier that day. Just like Floyd, a lot of protests happened after this unfortunate death of an aspiring nurse.

			<h1>Report on Taylor's death </h1>
			<p> In this report, the murder was explained and we can see the Breonna's family in grief after her unjustifiable death. If you think things aren't going to get worse, Breonna's boyfriend is in jail just because of self protection. This case still has not found justice, but got the attention of the whole country. Watch the report by clicking her picture at the right.
