			<h1> Background </h1>
			<p> Racism is social issue that concerns on discrimination and prejudice directed
				to any person or group of people solely based on their race or ethnic group. This is
				a social issue that has been around for a long time. But since quarantine season, an 
				awareness campaign has sparked after the saddening death of George Floyd. This caused
				a political and social movement, namely the "Black Lives Matter"; advocating for 
				non-violent disobedience in protest against police brutality and all racially motivated
				violence against black people. After this, the hashtags: "#JusticeforBreonnaTaylor" has
				been circulating around the internet just after the protests for George Floyd. Multiple
				victims of police brutality in the USA has been getting attention just after the
				saddening incidents that happened to George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many more victims. Note that this social issue isn't just happening in the USA, but also all over the world.
				This movement might be seen finished as there are lesser protests, but it is just getting started.
